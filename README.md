# 🚗 Decentralized Traffic Oracle Network (DTON)

Welcome to DTON, the blockchain-powered solution tackling urban traffic chaos! Using the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts, drivers contribute real-time traffic data via decentralized oracles, earning tokens while enabling smarter route optimization for everyone. Say goodbye to gridlock—hello to incentivized, privacy-preserving navigation!

## ✨ Features

🚦 Submit real-time traffic reports (speed, congestion, incidents) as oracle data
🗺️ AI-assisted route optimization with blockchain-verified data
💰 Earn DTON tokens for accurate contributions
🔒 Privacy-focused: Anonymized data sharing without central servers
📊 Query aggregated traffic analytics for apps or cities
⚖️ Dispute resolution for faulty reports to maintain data integrity
🌍 Scalable for fleets, rideshares, or personal use

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Drivers/Contributors**

- Install the DTON app and register your vehicle via the UserRegistry contract
- As you drive, submit traffic snapshots (e.g., GPS speed, hazards) to the TrafficOracle contract
- Get validated by peers oracles—accurate data mints DTON tokens via the IncentiveDistributor
- Use your tokens to request optimized routes from the RouteOptimizer

**For Route Planners (Apps/Fleets)**

- Query the DataAggregator for live traffic feeds
- Call optimize-route with start/end points—the contract triggers off-chain computation and verifies results
- Pay a micro-fee in DTON for premium routes, settled on-chain

**Under the Hood: 8 Clarity Smart Contracts**

- **TrafficOracle**: Handles data submission from drivers and basic validation (e.g., timestamp, location proofs).
- **DataAggregator**: Compiles oracle feeds into anonymized, queryable datasets for real-time use.
- **RouteOptimizer**: Requests and verifies optimal paths using aggregated data (integrates with off-chain solvers).
- **UserRegistry**: Onboards users/vehicles with KYC-lite proofs and tracks contribution history.
- **IncentiveDistributor**: Calculates and distributes DTON tokens based on data accuracy and usage impact.
- **TokenContract**: Manages the native DTON fungible token for rewards and fees (SIP-10 compliant).
- **DisputeResolver**: Allows challenges to bad data, with staking and arbitration via community votes.
- **AnalyticsQuery**: Provides read-only functions for traffic stats, enabling third-party integrations.
